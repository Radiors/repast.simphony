  <title>Working with External Models in Simphony</title>

  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Included with Repast Simphony is support for sending data out to
    files and reading data in from files based on an xml description of the
    files' contents. These xml descriptor files are designed to specify any
    text files, as long as they have some logical data specification. With
    this it is possible to have data in a <link linkend="???">Java Bean</link>
    </para>

    <para>The data file specification uses a small set of four xml tags.
    Through the nesting of this small set of tags, arbitrarily complex file
    formats can be specified. The tags and their uses are specified in Table
    1.</para>
