  <title>Working with External Models in Simphony</title>

  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Repast Simphony comes with support for working with external models.
    Provided are classes that will take in data, feed it to a model, run the
    model, and gather more data back. Currently, the primary way to transfer
    data to the external model and in from the external model is through
    files. This support is provided through the <link linkend="???">Data
    File</link> utilities which use a xml based descriptor file to specify the
    format data should be input from or output to.</para>
