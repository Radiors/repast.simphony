		This model extends the SIR model of infectious disease to include
		(1) Latency:  an explicit population of asymptomatic infectives
		(2) Different contact rates and infectivities for symptomatic and 
		    asymptomatic populations.
		See IM Chapter 9.

Asymptomatic Infectives A= INTEG (
	Infection Rate IR - Emergence Rate ER,
		Initial Asymptomatic Population)
	~	People
	~	The number of infectious but asymptomatic people.
	|

Recovery Rate RR=
	Symptomatic Population I/Average Duration of Illness d
	~	People/Day
	~	The recovery rate.   Fraction Surviving of those exiting the symptomatic \
		population recover; the rest die.
	|

Susceptible Population S= INTEG (
	-Infection Rate IR,
		Total Population N - Initial Asymptomatic Population - Initial Symptomatic Population\
		 - Initial Recovered Population)
	~	People
	~	The susceptible population.  Increased by births and loss of immunity by \
		recovered and immunized people.  Decreased by infection, death, and \
		immunization.
	|

Symptomatic Population I= INTEG (
	Emergence Rate ER- Recovery Rate RR,
		Initial Symptomatic Population)
	~	People
	~	The number of infectious people exhibiting symptoms.
	|

Infection Rate IR=
	Total Infectious Contacts C*Susceptible Population S/Total Population N
	~	People/Day
	~	the infection rate depends on the total number of contacts generated by \
		infectious individuals (adjusted for the infectivity of each category) \
		multiplied by the probability that these contacts occur with susceptible \
		individuals.
	|

Total Infectious Contacts C=
	 Contact Rate for Asymptomatic Infectives
	*Infectivity of Asymptomatic Infectives*Asymptomatic Infectives A + Contact Rate for Symptomatic Population\
		*Infectivity of Symptomatic Infectives
	*Symptomatic Population I
	~	People/Day
	~	The total number of infectious contacts generated each day is the sum of \
		the infectious contacts generated by the sympomatic infectives and those \
		generated by the asymptomatic population.  The contact rate and \
		infectivity of these categories can differ.

	~	The contact rate for asymptomatic individuals.
	|

Contact Rate for Symptomatic Population=

	~	The contact rate for symptomatic individuals.   Normally less than that \
		for asymptomatic people.
	|

Initial Asymptomatic Population=
	1
	~	People
	~	The initial number of asymptomatic individuals.
	|

Infectivity of Asymptomatic Infectives=

		individuals (the probability of infection given contact with an infected \
		person).

	0.25
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The infectivity of a contact between susceptible and symptomatic \
		individuals (the probability of infection given contact with an infected \
		person).
	|

Average Duration of Illness d=
	4
	~	Day
	~	The average duration of illness (the period during which people exhibit \
		symptoms and possess the infectivity associated with symptomatic patients).
	|

Average Incubation Time e=
	18
	~	Day
	~	Average latency or incubation period for the disease.
	|
