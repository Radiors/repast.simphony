Components and options:

States:

    SimpleState
        - id
        - onEnter (optional StateAction<T> with access to "agent" and "state", default empty method)
        - onExit (optional StateAction<T> with access to "agent" and "state", default empty method)
    
    CompositeState
        - id
        - onEnter (optional StateAction<T> with access to "agent" and "state", default empty method)
        - onExit (optional StateAction<T> with access to "agent" and "state", default empty method)
        
    BranchState
        - id
    
    HistoryState
        - id
        - onEnter (optional StateAction<T> with access to "agent" and "state", default empty method)
        - shallow (true/false)
    
    FinalState
        - id
        - onEnter (optional StateAction<T> with access to "agent" and "state", default empty method)


Transitions:

    Transition
        - priority (optional, default 0)
        - onTransition (optional TransitionAction<T> with access to "agent" and "transition", default empty method)
        - guard (optional GuardCondition<T> returning boolean with access to  "agent" and "transition", default returns true)
        - trigger (one of the following Triggers)
    
        Triggers:
            AlwaysTrigger
                - polling time (optional, default 1)
            
            TimedTrigger
                - time (length of time to trigger)
            
            ExponentialDecayRateTrigger
                - decay rate (where the interval used when initialized is Math.log(1-rand)/(-decayRate))
            
            ProbabilityTrigger
                - probability 
                - polling time (optional, default 1, so by default the probability is per time unit but can be changed by specifying polling time)
            
            ConditionTrigger
                - condition (ConditionTriggerCondition<T> returning boolean with access to  "agent" and "transition")
                - polling time (optional, default 1)
                
            MessageTrigger
                - polling time (optional, default 1)
                - messageChecker (one of the following)
    
    
            MessageCheckers:
                MessageConditionMessageChecker
                    - condition (MessageCondition<T> returning boolean with access to "agent" and "transition")
                
                MessageEqualsMessageChecker
                    - class (offer a drop down list and the option to include a fully qualified class name)
                    - object to check for equality using equals() 
                
                UnconditionalByClassMessageChecker
                    - class (offer a drop down list and the option to include a fully qualified class name)
            
                UnconditionalMessageChecker
            
    
    SelfTransition
        - same as transition
    
    OutOfBranchTransition
        - same as transition but trigger can only be a ConditionTrigger
    
    DefaultOutOfBranchTransition
        - same as transition but without trigger
