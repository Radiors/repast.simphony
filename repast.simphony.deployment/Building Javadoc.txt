Building Repast Javadoc

1. Select (only core projects, no ide or plugins stuff) to export javadoc.  An
     ant build script for javadoc doesn't work on Windows, so use the export method.
     
     - Need to include r.s.relogo.runtime but don't include other relogo projects
     - Don't include data analysis plugin projects, eg r.s.spreadsheet
     - Don't include /test folders, only use /src

2. Export javadoc for selected projects.  If javadoc reports errors, perhaps 
    some non-core projects were selected.

3. Copy the generated javadoc folder to RepastSimphonyAPI in the distriubution 
   /docs folder with the installer script. 

4. Run the buildGroovydocs ant script in r.s.relogo.runtime as described in the
    r.s.relogo.runtime/docs/Readme.txt.  
    
    - Groovydocs requires downloading a full Groovy SDK binary distribution.
    - Make sure the Groovy binary dist is current
    - Make sure the launch config for running the buildgroovydocs points to the new
        Groovy dist.

5.  Merge the results of the Groovydoc as described in the 
    r.s.relogo.runtime/docs/Readme.txt
