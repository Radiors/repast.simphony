Building Repast Javadoc

1. Select (only core projects, no ide or plugins stuff) to export javadoc.  An
     ant build script for javadoc doesn't work on Windows, so use the export method.
     
     - Select whole project to export, but only select the /src folder (no /test) 
       in the following projects to avoid exporting test class info.  
       This could be done in other projects, but causes errors, so omitting the 
       /test just the following is helpful:
       		- r.s.core
       		- r.s.statecharts
     - Specify the new version number in the javadoc title
     - Need to include r.s.relogo.runtime but don't include other relogo projects
     - Don't include data analysis plugin projects, eg r.s.spreadsheet
     - Don't include /test folders, only use /src

2. Export javadoc for selected projects.  If javadoc reports errors, perhaps 
    some non-core projects were selected.

3. Copy the generated javadoc folder to RepastSimphonyAPI in the distriubution 
   /docs folder with the installer script. 

4. Run the buildGroovydocs ant script in r.s.relogo.runtime as described in the
    r.s.relogo.runtime/docs/Readme.txt Step 1.  
    
    - Groovydocs requires downloading a full Groovy SDK binary distribution. 
      This SDK is simply an archive with groovy jars that can be stored in some
      convienient system location, eg /libs.
      
    - The buildGroovyDocs.xml launch configuration Classpath settings must be
      updated to reflect the location of the unpacked groovy /libs folder.  
      These will be the "groovy-...jar" files and one or two of the other jars
      in the groovy /lib folder (see existing launch config).
      
    - The buildGroovyDocs.xml launch configuration JRE settings should be 
       "Separate JRE" not "Run in same JRE as workspace" since using the later
       causes issues (on Windows) even though they are the same JRE!
    
    - The version number in buildGroovyDocs.xml should be updated.
    
    - Last, just run the buildGroovyDocs.xml as an ant script.  This can take
      several minutes to run.  If the Terminate process button is red then it
      is still running.

5.  Merge the results of the Groovydoc as described in the 
    r.s.relogo.runtime/docs/Readme.txt
