BUILDING AN UPDATE SITE

1. Make new workspace (not strictly necessary but easier), clean check out
of the plugins from eclipse. 

2. If repast.simphony.demos and repast.simphony.demo.predatorprey projects 
are in the workspace, remove them. They need to be removed from the workspace
directory entirely so they are not picked up by the deploy.xml.

3. Check out the repast.simphony.updatesite project. That needs to be located
in a directory other than the one that contains the various r.s.* projects.

4. In r.s.eclipse, change the REPAST_VERSION to the new version number. If using the
plugin editor, this is in the plugin.xml tab.

5. In repast.simphony.eclipse.RepastSimphonyPlugin.java in r.s.eclipse
change the REPAST_SIMPHONY_PLUGIN_VERSION to the new version number.

6. Update the plugin_jpf.xmls to the new version number: use the update_jpf_plugins.xml 
in r.s.deployment. FIRST change the rs.version number in this file. Note that this
requires the xmltask.jar in antlib so run it accordingly.

7. Update the plugin.restrict.simphony property in boot.properties in r.s.runtime/ 
with the new version number.

8. Update the feature version in feature.xml in r.s.feature in the overview tab.
In the plugins tab, click the versions button and select force feature version into
plugin. The listed plugins should now be updated to the correct version number.

9. Run deploy.xml to create the bin and src jar. If there is not
an existing bin_and_src.jar when this is run, it will need to be run twice in
order to get the bin_and_src.jar itself into the "RawClasspath".

10. Make sure the r.s.updatesite project contains two empty folders (features and plugins) 
and only the site.xml file.

11. Open the site.xml file. If the feature listed is a previous one, remove it and 
add the new one. Click "Build All" to create the site.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. You may see this error:

error while reading original manifest in file:
/Users/nick/Documents/workspace/rs_dist_clean/repast.simphony.bin_and_src/repast.simphony.bin_and_src.jar
error in opening zip file

when running deploy.xml. It can be ignored, just run deploy.xml again.

2. If after upgrading simphony using the update site, you see an error like:

The container 'Repast Simphony Development Libraries' references non existing library 
'/Applications/Repast-Simphony-2.0.0-beta copy/eclipse/plugins/
repast.simphony.core_2.0.1/test/watcher_test.jar'

Add the non-existing library to the set of those excluded in deploy.xml in the
"BinAndSrcJAR" target. Note that the relevant part here is the reference to 
the non-existent library, not the watcher_test.jar in particular.
